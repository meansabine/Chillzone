Backend BS

- Started transition towards a fully Attribute variable system instead of declaring variables per command.
- Started multiple new commands!
- Changed how controls are displayed.
- Changed how number slider accelerates; instead of a fixed 800 max, it is now capped at the max of the number arg max * 1.25.


Comment on stability:
Chillzone currently is pretty server load intensive when multiple people are using the menu, which can easily lead to server crashes. As of right now, I am working on updates to help reduce the impact on server load so that the menu is more efficient. I'd say right now its cut out to handle max 8 players, but you could always try more!

[chillzone 1.5.1a] - stability updates

{with CZ 1.5.0, it seems that it didn't take well to OW2 well(at all), and decided to crash the server any time it could get!
but now i got to take a look and see where things might be going wrong and how it directly affects the performance of the server!
and i found a couple parts that were causing enormous(HUGE) problems in server stability. there will be small
and almost not noticable changes coming to the menu that will help relieve a decent amount of the load. with that being said,
there are chances that bugs may arise since there are big back end changes. please tell me on discord(sabine#0320) if you
run into anything out of the ordinary. this update should help with server stability though!}

- Made changes to internal bool system to help reduce heft on server load(rainbow....)
- Made changes to opening, closing, and recursing menu on backend
- Now has a time between page changes(very tiny but needed)
- Many many many more back end changes


[chillzone 1.5.2] - ZIPLINES & comment on stability

{with CZ 1.5.1, stability was improved but not completely. CZ can right now support 7 people or less,
increase at your own risk. more updates are underway to improve stability. please tell me on discord(sabine#0320) if you
run into anything out of the ordinary. this update should help with server stability though!}

- INTRODUCING ZIPLINES! Players can now create their own personal Zip Lines using the new Zip Line Creator Mode command(max 10 ziplines)
- Added new commands
- "Fixed Camera" - Fixes the camera to be stuck in one location [On/Off]
- "Zipline Creation Mode" - Enables the Zipline Creation Mode [On/Off]
- "Destroy All Personal Ziplines" - Removes all of your personal ziplines
- Temporarily disabled "Communicate Player" as this is currently bugged in the OW2 workshop.
